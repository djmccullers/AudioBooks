The first two novels are planetary romances with elements of medieval mythology. Each planet is seen as having a tutelary spirit; those of the other planets are both good and accessible, while that of Earth is fallen, twisted, and not known directly by most humans. The story is powerfully imagined, and the effects of lesser gravity on Martian planet and animal life is vividly rendered.<\/p>","image":"Out of the Silent Planet.jpg","author":"C. S.

But in the many layers of its allegory, and the sophistication and piercing brilliance of its insights into the human condition, it occupies a place among the English language\u2019s most extraordinary works for any age, and for all time.<\/p> <p>Perelandra is a planet of pleasure, an unearthly, misty world of strange desires, sweet smells, and delicious tastes, where beasts are friendly and naked beauty is unashamed, a new Garden of Eden, where the story of the oldest temptation is enacted in an intriguingly new way. Here, in the second part of C. S. Lewis\u2019s acclaimed Ransom Trilogy, Dr. Ransom\u2019s adventures continue against the backdrop of a religious allegory that, while it may seem quaint in its treatment of women today, nonetheless shows the capability of science to be an evil force tempting a ruler away from the path that has produced a paradisiacal kingdom. Will Perelandra succumb to this malevolent being, who strives to create a new world order, or will it throw off the yoke of corruption and achieve a spiritual perfection as yet unknown to man?<\/p>","image":"Perelandra.jpg","author":"C.

No one except Jane. But ahead lies only risk. Because those arrayed against her are legion...and dangerously devoted to protecting something profoundly important - or terrifying - enough to exterminate any and all in their way. <\/p> <p>Too many have already died, and those responsible will learn that all their malevolent power may not be enough to stop a woman as clever as they are cold-blooded, as relentless as they are ruthless - and who is driven by a righteous rage they can never comprehend.

Osmark is devious and power hungry, and it's only a matter of time before he sends his forces to wipe Jack and his underdog crew off the map for good. <\/p> <p>If Jack hopes to survive another month inside of VGO, he must find a way to beat Osmark and his army of bloodthirsty thugs, and a new quest - the Path of the Jade Lord - may be just the ticket. But this quest will be far harder than anything Jack's faced before, pushing him to his mental, physical, and moral limits. And if Jack isn't careful, his quest to defeat Osmark and the Empire may end up turning him into the despot he's been fighting against. <\/p>","image":"Viridian Gate Online The Jade Lord A litRPG Adventure.jpg","author":"James Hunter","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kwky+OHdL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"Viridian Gate Online: The Jade Lord: A litRPG Adventure","rating_count":"6565","mp3":"Viridian Gate Online The Jade Lord A litRPG Adventure.mp3","filename":"Viridian Gate Online The Jade Lord A litRPG Adventure","release_date":"2017-10-16","user_id":"amzn1.account.AEPUGHGHK2MN3NTOVRECFAHLDQDQ","ayce":"true","publisher":"Shadow Alley Press Inc.","files":["mp3"],"asin":"B076DHSSVD","purchase_date":"2022-01-15","region":"US"},{"rating_average":"4.2894736842105265","copyright":"©2007 Night Shade Books;℗2008 Blackstone Audio, Inc.","chapters":"","series_link":"https://www.audible.com/series/Hardwired-Audiobook/B075MT28RT","description":"Steward is a clone, a beta.

It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. <\/b><\/p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine<\/i> as \u201cthe greatest epic in the history of comic books\u201d, <i>The Sandman <\/i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times<\/i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split<\/i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman<\/i> originally re-defined the graphic novel. <\/p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three \u201ctools\u201d that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more. <\/p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you\u2019ve never heard anything like this.<\/p>","image":"The Sandman.jpg","author":"Neil Gaiman, Dirk Maggs","image_url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CEI+8TpdL._SL500_.jpg","title_short":"The Sandman","rating_count":"51846","mp3":"The Sandman.mp3","filename":"The Sandman","release_date":"2020-07-15","user_id":"amzn1.account.AEPUGHGHK2MN3NTOVRECFAHLDQDQ","ayce":"false","publisher":"Audible Originals","files":["mp3"],"asin":"B086WP794Z","purchase_date":"2021-09-10","region":"US"},{"rating_average":"4.277777777777778","copyright":"©1979 Gordon R.

Across America, a mysterious pathogen transforms ordinary people into raging killers, psychopaths driven by a terrifying, alien agenda. The human race fights back, yet after every battle the disease responds, adapts, using sophisticated strategies and brilliant ruses to fool its pursuers. The only possible explanation: The epidemic is driven not by evolution but by some malevolent intelligence.<\/p> <p>Standing against this unimaginable threat is a small group, assembled under the strictest secrecy. Their best weapon is hulking former football star Perry Dawsey, left psychologically shattered by his own struggles with this terrible enemy, who possesses an unexplainable ability to locate the disease\u2019s hosts. Violent and unpredictable, Perry is both the nation\u2019s best hope and a terrifying liability.<\/p> <p>Hardened CIA veteran Dew Phillips must somehow forge a connection with him if they\u2019re going to stand a chance against this maddeningly adaptable opponent. Alongside them is Margaret Montoya, a brilliant epidemiologist who fights for a cure even as she reels under the weight of endless horrors. These three and their team have kept humanity in the game, but that\u2019s not good enough anymore, not when the disease turns contagious, triggering a fast countdown to Armageddon. Meanwhile, other enemies join the battle, and a new threat - one that comes from a most unexpected source - may ultimately prove the most dangerous of all.<\/p> <p>Catapulting the listener into a world where humanity\u2019s life span is measured in hours and the president\u2019s finger hovers over the nuclear button, rising star Scott Sigler takes us on a breathtaking, hyper-adrenalized ride filled with terror and jaw-dropping action.
